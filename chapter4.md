# DECENTRALIZED BLOCKCHAIN-BASED VOTING SYSTEM

## CHAPTER FOUR: SYSTEM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

### 4.1 Objective of Design

The primary objective of the Decentralized Blockchain-Based Voting System is to create a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof electronic voting platform that leverages blockchain technology. The system aims to:

1. Ensure the integrity and immutability of the voting process
2. Provide transparent yet privacy-preserving vote recording
3. Enable voters to verify their votes without compromising the secrecy of the ballot
4. Eliminate the possibility of double-voting through cryptographic verification
5. Create an auditable trail of voting records that cannot be altered
6. Make the voting process more accessible while maintaining security

### 4.2 System Architecture in Terms of Tiers

The system follows a modern three-tier architecture enhanced with blockchain components:

```
*Figure 4.1: Three-tier System Architecture*

1. **Presentation Tier**: 
   - Built with Next.js React framework
   - Responsive UI for different device types
   - Client-side functionality for wallet connection
   - Real-time feedback and status indicators

2. **Application Tier**:
   - Next.js API routes for server-side processing
   - Authentication services (traditional and Web3)
   - Election management subsystem
   - Vote processing and verification
   - Blockchain transaction handling

3. **Data Tier**:
   - MongoDB database for structured data storage
   - Simulated blockchain for immutable vote records
   - Transaction hash generation for vote verification

### 4.3 Choice of Programming Environment

The system was developed using the following technologies:

1. **Frontend Development**:
   - **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation
   - **TypeScript**: For type-safe code and better developer experience
   - **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern UI components

2. **Backend Development**:
   - **Next.js API Routes**: For serverless API endpoints
   - **MongoDB**: For database management
   - **NextAuth.js**: For authentication handling
   - **Crypto**: For cryptographic operations

3. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - **Web3.js**: For blockchain interactions
   - **Wallet connection libraries**: For integrating with cryptocurrency wallets

4. **Development Tools**:
   - **npm**: For package management
   - **Git**: For version control
   - **VS Code**: As the primary IDE

The choice of Next.js enables both frontend and backend to be built within the same codebase, simplifying deployment and management.

### 4.4 Database Structure

The database structure was designed to support both traditional user data and blockchain-related information:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ Vote : casts
    Election ||--o{ Vote : contains
    Election ||--o{ Candidate : lists
    User {
        string _id
        string name
        string email
        string passwordHash
        string walletAddress
        string role
        date createdAt
    }
    Election {
        string _id
        string title
        string description
        array candidates
        date startDate
        date endDate
        string createdBy
        date createdAt
    }
    Vote {
        string _id
        string electionId
        string voterId
        string candidate
        date timestamp
        string transactionHash
    }
    Candidate {
        string name
    }
```

The database design focuses on maintaining the relationships between users, elections, and votes while ensuring the integrity of the voting process.
